    ### üß† **Key Takeaways**
    - **Stake** is highly concentrated among a few validators, as indicated by a high Gini coefficient.
    - **Credits (voting activity)** are more evenly distributed, enabling smaller validators to actively contribute.
    - The **weak correlation between stake and credits** suggests that operational decentralization exists despite capital concentration.
    - This dynamic supports network resilience but also raises questions about **governance and reward fairness**.
